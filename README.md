<br>
The player can only jump onto pillars that are the same color as them (red player, red pillars)
<br>
I increased the speed of the character and how fast they rotate.
<br>
I made the arena longer to have more pillars inside and just more space to move around.

<br>
Update 1
<br>
scores put into the corners and keep track of player one and two
<br>
Shows win screen after either player gets 15 points
<br>
Update 2
<br>
moved all the trigger code into one script , no lobger in two seperate ones for the two players
<br> 
added blocks that the players can knock over onto each other
<br>
added collectible items, potatoes and sprites (the soda)
<br>
added a shared inventory to the game along with equipping
<br>
the items both add 5 points to the score
<br>
new rule: only player 1 can pick up and use potatos and player two can only pick up and use Sprite
