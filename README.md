# LeapFrog
First Upload:
<br>
The player can only jump onto pillars that are the same color as them (red player, red pillars)
<br>
I increased the speed of the character and how fast they rotate.
<br>
I made the arena longer to have more pillars inside and just more space to move around.

<br>
Update 1
<br>
scores put into the corners and keep track of player one and two
<br>
Shows win screen after either player gets 15 points

<br><br>
Update 2
<br>
moved all the trigger code into one script , no lobger in two seperate ones for the two players
<br> 
added blocks that the players can knock over onto each other
<br>
added collectible items, potatoes and sprites (the soda)
<br>
added a shared inventory to the game along with equipping
<br>
the items both add 5 points to the score
<br>
new rule: only player 1 can pick up and use potatos and player two can only pick up and use Sprite
<br><br>
Update 3 
<br>
got rid of the leap frog scoring system and replaced with only an item collect and use to get points.
<br>
new game mechanic- push the person away from their object to prevent them from getting all of them (player 1 uses o and player 2 uses e to push)
<br>
have to get three items (5 points per item, first one to 15 points)
<br>
players now move using wasd or ijkl and jump using q or u
<br> 
if players pick up an item thats not theirs the other player can still use it, so beware not to pick up your opponents items because they can use them still!
